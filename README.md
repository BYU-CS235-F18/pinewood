# pinewood derby simulation program
If you have worked with Cub Scouts, you know they get really excited about the pinewood derby race.  If your Cub Scout Pack is low on funds, they probably only have a 2 lane track and so you will have to race each pair of cars against each other to determine the winner.  Some cars have rockets on them, some cars have big stuffed animals on top that increase the wind resistance, but all of them need to be kept in the race conainer.  Build an application to simulate a pinewood derby race.
